# Student GitHub Accounts

For this course, I encourage you to collaborate on the assignments to help you learn the material and improve your coding skill. Please use each other's public GitHub repositories to see how another student solved a problem, either as a comparison to how you solved it or as a solution for how to solve the assignment.
